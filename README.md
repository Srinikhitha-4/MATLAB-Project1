# MATLAB-Project1
This project involves creating a block-based hearing aid simulation using MATLAB’s Audio Toolbox™ and Simulink™, incorporating key signal processing techniques such as dynamic range compression, noise reduction, and feedback cancellation, and testing in real-time with a headset or pre-recorded audio.
